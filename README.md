# Kyle's Repository of Learning
Hey, my name is [Kyle](https://github.com/AtkinsonKyle), and I'm in the new 102 class at Code Fellows. My goal is to learn as much as possible so I can become fluent in multiple languages!

## Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is one that is always learning! Making mistakes doesn't have to be a bad thing, it should encourage you to keep charging forward.

### Keeping myself in a growth mindset
1. Keep trying until I get it right.
1. I should learn something new everyday.
1. Always remember, success is the journey, not the destination.
