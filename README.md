# Kyle's Repository of Learning
Hey, my name is [Kyle](https://github.com/AtkinsonKyle), and I'm in the new 102 class at Code Fellows. My goal is to learn as much as possible so I can become fluent in multiple languages! 

## Growth Mindset
> A growth mindset is one that is always learning! Making mistakes doesn't have to be a bad thing, it should encourage you to keep charging forward.

### Keeping myself in a growth mindset
1. Keep trying until I get it right.
1. I should learn something new everyday.
1. Always remember, success is the journey, not the destination.


## Markdown Notes
> Markdown is a light weight markup language for authoring readable, functional code on the fly
- "`#`"  level one heading
- "`###`"  level three heading


### Multiple Bullets, One List
- **this text is _important_**
- ***"`***`"  is bold and italicized***
- "`~~`" ~~is deleted~~
  -* *"`* *`"  is italic*
  - **"`**`"  is bold**
+ more bullet
+ points, but with
+ plus signs
