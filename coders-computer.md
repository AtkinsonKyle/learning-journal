# Text Editors
> Ideal for writing code, a text editor is a piece of software that you download on your computer, or you access through a web browser, that allows you to write in order to build a web site. Software developers need to choose the correct text editor for their task. Depending on the tools, they each can provide different benefits for a coder. 

## Great Features of Different Text Editors
